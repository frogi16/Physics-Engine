# Physics-Engine
Basic physics engine allowing to easily create realistic simulations in VPython. Classical mechanics and collisions between spheres and boxes are already supported, as well as implementation of springs subject to Hooke's law. Currently there are efforts to add rotations and impulses, which would greatly improve usefulness of the engine.

Approximation of Pi using colliding boxes of certain masses (greater ratio = more digits). [Video explaining the idea.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEfHFsfGXjs)

Elastic collisions of balls in enclosed space. It is a good model of atoms in thermal agitation or billiard balls. Minor glitches are noticeable when many balls collide at the same time.

Solar system simulated as if Sun was the only mass (planets are enlarged for clarity) . Allows dynamic changes in reference point, which reveals beautiful patterns.
